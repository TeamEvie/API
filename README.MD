This repo's purpose was to make a backend for everything Evie related, but putting multiple projects into one API would be hard especially since we use different databases for projects.
We will most likely repurpose this as a template for a Prisma and Minima API.

# Evie Backend

> Slowly but surely, all Evie Related APIs will be migrated to this project.

## Development

1. Install [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
2. Install Dependencies - `go get`
3. Install [Air](https://github.com/cosmtrek/air)
4. Generate Prisma `go run github.com/prisma/prisma-client-go generate`
5. Run Air - `air`
6. Enjoy writing code with hot reloading.
